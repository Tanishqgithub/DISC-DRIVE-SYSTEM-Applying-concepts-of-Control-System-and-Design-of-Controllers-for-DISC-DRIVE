# DISC-DRIVE-SYSTEM-Applying-concepts-of-Control-System-and-Design-of-Controllers-for-DISC-DRIVE


The report created for this repository contains all the matlab code and simulation outputs and the design of COntrollers using matlab Simulink 
The below are Concepts of Control Systems applied on the System :
1. pole-zero map
2. open loop response {unit step and unit ramp response}
3. staedy state error
4. RH Criterion
5. Performance parameters {rise time,transient time,settling time,overshoot,undershoot,peak,peak time}
6. Root Locus
7. Bode Plot
8. Nyquist Plot

Along with the above Concepts even the DESIGN OF CONTROLLERS are included for a specific Design Specification given in the question only .
1. Propotion Controller
2. PD Controller
3. PI Controller
4. PID Controller
5. Robustness Check
